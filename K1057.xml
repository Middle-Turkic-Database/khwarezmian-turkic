        <note>The manuscript consisted of 129 folios, 71 of which includes the Siraj al-Qulub in
          Khwarezmian Turkic (Yaman 2016) and 58 of which includes the Falnama in Khwarezmian
          Turkic (Onur 2022). The place of copying and the name of the copyist are unknown. The last
          pages are missing, so we don’t know when the Falnama was copied. However, it is
          understood that both the Siraj al-Qulub and the Falnamah were written by the same copyist. The
          copying date of the Siraj al-Qulub is 1362. It is therefore possible to say that the
          Falnama was also copied around 1362. The linguistic differences between the two texts
          show that these two texts, written by the same copyist, were not composed by the same
          author (or translator).

              In some folios of the manuscript there are marginal notes about people whose fortunes
              were told. One of them is Mevlana Sinan, an Ottoman poet with the pseudonym Şeyhî, and
              another is Oruc Bey, the Beylerbey of Anatolia, and his successor Hamza Bey (Kandemir
              1961: VI; Onur 2020: 101). These marginal notes indicate that the manuscript was used
              for fortune-telling in the Edirne Palace during the reign of Murad II, i.e. in the
              first half of the 15th century.

      <creation>The language of the text represents Early Eastern Middle Turkic of the 13th to <date>14th
        century</date>, known as Khwarezmian Turkic. However, some linguistic features of the text
        (mostly lexical), which are close to Western Turkic, set it apart from all the other
        Khwarezmian Turkic sources. These features indicate that the work was probably composed by
        an Oguz in <origPlace>Western Turkestan</origPlace>. In particular, the fact that the text contains many words
        peculiar to Old Anatolian Turkish, which do not appear in any Khwarezmian Turkic source,
        suggests that it was written by a member of an Oguz tribe who had not participated in the
        migrations to Anatolia.
